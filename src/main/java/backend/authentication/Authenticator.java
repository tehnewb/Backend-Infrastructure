/**
 * The {@code Authenticator} class provides mechanisms to authenticate a {@link User}
 * based on a series of {@link Requirement} checks. It evaluates whether a user meets
 * all specified requirements to determine if authentication is successful.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to be flexible and can be used to define custom
 * authentication flows by specifying different {@code Requirement} instances. Each
 * {@code Requirement} represents a condition that must be satisfied for authentication
 * to succeed. The class sequentially checks each requirement and returns the result
 * of the first failing requirement, or a success message if all requirements are met.</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * User user = new User();
 * user.attribute("Username", "JohnSmith");
 * user.attribute("Password", "Password123");
 * Requirement passwordRequirement = new PasswordRequirement();
 * Requirement emailRequirement = new EmailRequirement();
 * Authenticator authenticator = new Authenticator(passwordRequirement, emailRequirement);
 * AuthenticationResult result = authenticator.authenticate(user);
 * if (result.success())
 *      handleSuccessfulAuthentication();
 * }</pre>
