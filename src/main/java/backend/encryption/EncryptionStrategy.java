/**
 * The {@code EncryptionStrategy} interface defines a contract for implementing
 * both asymmetric and symmetric encryption and decryption strategies. Classes
 * that implement this interface are expected to provide mechanisms to securely
 * encrypt and decrypt data using the appropriate cryptographic algorithms.
 *
 * <p>The interface is designed to be flexible and can be implemented by classes
 * that handle different encryption techniques, such as AES for symmetric key
 * encryption or RSA for asymmetric key encryption. The interface defines two
 * essential methods: {@link #encrypt(byte[])} for encryption and {@link #decrypt(byte[])}
 * for decryption.
 *
 * <p><strong>Implementing Classes:</strong></p>
 * <p>Classes that implement this interface must ensure that they can handle
 * encryption and decryption operations in a secure manner. Example implementations
 * include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code AES} - An implementation that uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm.</li>
 *   <li>{@code RSA} - An implementation that uses the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface does not define the specific algorithm or key management
 * processes, leaving those details to the implementing classes. It is recommended
 * that implementations provide robust error handling and security features, such as
 * preventing unauthorized access to the keys used for encryption and decryption.
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EncryptionStrategy encryptionStrategy = new AES(secretKey);
 * byte[] encryptedData = encryptionStrategy.encrypt(plainTextData);
 * byte[] decryptedData = encryptionStrategy.decrypt(encryptedData);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above example shows how an implementation of the {@code EncryptionStrategy}
 * interface can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. In this case, the {@code AES}
 * class, which implements the interface, is instantiated and used for symmetric encryption.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong></p>
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are not inherently thread-safe. It is the
 * responsibility of the implementing class to ensure thread safety if instances
 * are to be used concurrently across multiple threads.</p>
