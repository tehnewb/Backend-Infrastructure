/**
 * The {@code EventPublisher} class is responsible for managing the publication of
 * events and the registration of listeners that handle these events. This class
 * acts as a central hub for event-driven architecture, allowing different parts
 * of an application to communicate with each other through events.
 *
 * <p>For an {@code Event} to be processed, an {@code EventListener} must first be
 * registered with this {@code EventPublisher}. When an event is published, all
 * registered listeners for that specific event type are notified and given the
 * opportunity to handle the event. The order in which listeners are notified is
 * determined by their priority, which can be specified using the {@link EventPriority}
 * annotation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EventPublisher eventPublisher = new EventPublisher();
 *
 * eventPublisher.register(MyEvent.class, new MyEventListener());
 *
 * MyEvent event = new MyEvent();
 * eventPublisher.publish(event);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, a listener for {@code MyEvent} is registered with the
 * {@code EventPublisher}, and an instance of {@code MyEvent} is published. The
 * listener will handle the event according to its defined behavior.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong></p>
 * <p>The {@code EventPublisher} class is thread-safe, as both the registration
 * and publication methods are synchronized. This ensures that listeners can be
 * safely registered and events can be safely published from multiple threads.
